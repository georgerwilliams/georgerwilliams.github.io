                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Almost three decades ago I was standing in Centinela hospital in Inglewood, California when a nurse handed me my first child, a son. I was a new father. As I held him and stared into his face, I can remember smiling so much that my face began to hurt. And then it hit me, as I panicked for a moment as I thought to myself, “Is that nurse going to give me some information so I know what to do with my baby son?” I needed help but for better or worse, I did not ask her or anyone else for it. That day I began my adventurous journey as a father of three sons and a daughter who are my greatest treasures on earth.</p>
                <p>I grew up with my father, mother and five siblings in the racially and ethnically diverse city of Junction City, Kansas in a household that by federal guidelines was declared poor. My African American father was retired from the army and worked a low wage job. My mother was from Korea and suffered trauma from the war and was hospitalized many times during my childhood for a mental disorder.  But while we had many hardship and challenges, we did have a father and mother who loved us the best they knew how. We lived in a neighborhood where most households did not have the fortune of both parents but had fathers that were “MIA” (Missing in Action). Most of the outcomes for the children who were my neighborhood friends, to my dismay, did not turn out well.</p>
                <p>The outcomes for my siblings and I who did have a father and mother turned out well.  My mother was illiterate and I never heard about my father’s graduation from high school but all the siblings are first generation college graduates with six bachelor degrees, seven master degrees, and three Ph.Ds..  My brothers excelled in science and engineering.  The oldest, Robert earned a doctorate in electrical engineering.  He is a former DARPA program manager, director of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Discovery Lab and the 2013 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) “Engineer of the Year”. The second is Morgan with two master degrees from MIT in aeroastro engineering and mathematics.  As a Boeing innovator he was awarded Boeing’s “Special Invention Award” for his research in Fluid Flow Modeling Systems and Device Interchanging Capability. And the third is Andrew who was the first African American to graduate from the University of Kansas with a doctorate in Electrical Engineering.  He is the John P. Raynor, S.J., Distinguished Chair and Director of the Humanoid Engineering and Intelligent Robotics Lab Engineering at Marquette University.  He was recognized by Black Money magazine as one of the “50 Most Important African Americans in Technology” in 2010, 2011, 2012. All these accomplishments are tied to a father who was a strong supporter of education and avid reader, especially of Popular Science and Popular Mechanics magazines.</p>
                <p>I graduated from Kansas State University with a bachelor of science in computer science, married my college sweetheart, and worked in that field for 13 years mostly in diverse Southern California. I remember attending a Promise Keepers rally and receiving the Today’s Father magazine from the National Center for Fathering. I was amazed that there was an organization for the specific purpose of inspiring and equipping men to be better fathers. I was finally getting the information I needed, but as a new father I did not ask. About four years after that conference I was invited by my brother-in-law, Dr. Bernard Franklin to join the organization to help him work with urban men.  One year after I joined him, he left to start a church. I stayed on and began a new adventure of helping men to be the fathers their children need, giving them the help they needed but rarely requested. I obtained a master’s degree in marriage and family therapy at Friends University to study theory that could guide my work with fathers.</p>

                <p>Over the next decade through work at the National Center I have had opportunities that I never imagined I would experience working in the fatherhood field. I have spoken at state and national conferences, written for and appeared in national magazines, trained trainers across the country, appeared on a national news network, been a reoccurring guest on a talk show, held workshops for a professional football team, testified as an expert witness before a Senate subcommittee, authored curricula, became a contributing author for an anthology on fatherhood, and visited the first Lady’s White House conference and reception in 2007. Of all these experiences what I value the most is the exchanges that took place in working with small groups of men from very challenging situations whose passion for their children could inspire us all to be better fathers. I thought I was helping men become better father when in reality they were helping me much of the time.</p>

                <p>My passion for working with fathers is driven by wanting the best for children. And my reason for pursuing of a doctorate in family studies was to develop expertise in research methodology, family theory, and the practice of providing educational and preventative services for fathers and families. It is my desire to become a uniquely qualified professional with expertise in creating, providing, and evaluating effective services for men to be the fathers their children need.</p>
