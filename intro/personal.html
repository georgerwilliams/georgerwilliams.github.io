                <h1>My Story</h1>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Almost three decades ago I was standing in Centinela hospital in Inglewood, California when a nurse handed me my first child, a son. I was a new father. As I held him and stared into his face, I can remember smiling so much that my face began to hurt. And then it hit me, as I panicked for a moment as I thought to myself, “Is that nurse going to give me some information so I know what to do with my baby son?” I needed help but for better or worse, I did not ask her or anyone else for it. That day I began my adventurous journey as a father of three sons and a daughter who are my greatest treasures on earth.</p>
                <p>I grew up with my father, mother and five siblings in the racially and ethnically diverse city of Junction City, Kansas in a household that by federal guidelines was declared poor. My African American father was retired from the army and worked a low wage job. My mother was from Korea and suffered trauma from the war and was hospitalized many times during my childhood for a mental disorder.  But while we had many hardship and challenges, we did have a father and mother who loved us the best they knew how. We lived in a neighborhood where most households did not have the fortune of both parents but had fathers that were “MIA” (Missing in Action). Most of the outcomes for the children who were my neighborhood friends, to my dismay, did not turn out well.</p>
                <p>The outcomes for my siblings and I who did have a father and mother turned out well.  My mother was illiterate and I never heard about my father’s graduation from high school but all the siblings are first generation college graduates with six bachelor degrees, seven master degrees, and three Ph.Ds..  My brothers excelled in science and engineering.  The oldest, Robert earned a doctorate in electrical engineering.  He is a former DARPA program manager, director of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Discovery Lab and the 2013 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) “Engineer of the Year”. The second is Morgan with two master degrees from MIT in aeroastro engineering and mathematics.  As a Boeing innovator he was awarded Boeing’s “Special Invention Award” for his research in Fluid Flow Modeling Systems and Device Interchanging Capability. And the third is Andrew who was the first African American to graduate from the University of Kansas with a doctorate in Electrical Engineering.  He is the John P. Raynor, S.J., Distinguished Chair and Director of the Humanoid Engineering and Intelligent Robotics Lab Engineering at Marquette University.  He was recognized by Black Money magazine as one of the “50 Most Important African Americans in Technology” in 2010, 2011, 2012. All these accomplishments are tied to a father who was a strong supporter of education and avid reader, especially of Popular Science and Popular Mechanics magazines.</p>
                <p>I graduated from Kansas State University with a bachelor of science in computer science, married my college sweetheart, and worked in that field for 13 years mostly in diverse Southern California. I remember attending a Promise Keepers rally and receiving the Today’s Father magazine from the National Center for Fathering. I was amazed that there was an organization for the specific purpose of inspiring and equipping men to be better fathers. I was finally getting the information I needed, but as a new father I did not ask. About four years after that conference I was invited by my brother-in-law, Dr. Bernard Franklin to join the organization to help him work with urban men.  One year after I joined him, he left to start a church. I stayed on and began a new adventure of helping men to be the fathers their children need, giving them the help they needed but rarely requested. I obtained a master’s degree in marriage and family therapy at Friends University to study theory that could guide my work with fathers.</p>

                <p>Over the next decade through work at the National Center I have had opportunities that I never imagined I would experience working in the fatherhood field. I have spoken at state and national conferences, written for and appeared in national magazines, trained trainers across the country, appeared on a national news network, been a reoccurring guest on a talk show, held workshops for a professional football team, testified as an expert witness before a Senate subcommittee, authored curricula, became a contributing author for an anthology on fatherhood, and visited the first Lady’s White House conference and reception in 2007. Of all these experiences what I value the most is the exchanges that took place in working with small groups of men from very challenging situations whose passion for their children could inspire us all to be better fathers. I thought I was helping men become better father when in reality they were helping me much of the time.</p>

                <p>My passion for working with fathers is driven by wanting the best for children. And my reason for pursuing of a doctorate in family studies was to develop expertise in research methodology, family theory, and the practice of providing educational and preventative services for fathers and families. It is my desire to become a uniquely qualified professional with expertise in creating, providing, and evaluating effective services for men to be the fathers their children need.</p>

                <h1>My Interests</h1>
                <div class="underline"></div> 
                <p>I have a number of interest but would like to share two of them.  The first is that I enjoy guitar music and playing the guitar.  My favorite music style is evolving.  Instead of one great guitar, I have a few "good enough" guitars to support the different music styles.  The first guitar is the Ibanez Montage.</p>
                <h3>Guitars</h3>
                <div class="image">
                <img src="../pictures/montage500.jpg" alt="Ibanez Montage MSC500">
            </div>
                <h4>Ibanez Montage MSC500</h4>
                 <p>I was trying to get one guitar to do it all.  This was a low cost version of the way much better made and sounding Taylor T5.  The Montage is extremely versatile with a decent acoustic sound and a clean and dirty electric sound with some essential effects. The Montage is suitable for all styles of music.  The model I purchased was the low-end.</p>
                
                <p>The Ibanez Montage Series Cutaway Acoustic-Electric is a revolutionary guitar that has two acoustic sounds, 2 electric sounds, mix capability, onboard reverb, chorus, distortion, phase canceling, dual notch filter and tuner. These groundbreaking, innovative electronics are possible with the combination of the B-Band® UST Acoustic Pickup, Ibanez AP9 Electric pickup, and the Ibanez HBP Multi-function Preamp with Onboard Tuner. Controls are conveniently mounted on the face of the upper bout. Operates on 4 AA batteries and has a 1⁄4" balanced output.</p>
                      <div class="image">
                <img src="../pictures/artcore91.jpg" alt="Ibanez Artcore AFJ91">
            </div>
                <h4>Ibanez Artcore AFJ91</h4>
                <p>One of my favorite music styles is jazz.  I enjoy the distinct sound of various jazz guitarists like George Benson, Johnathan Butler, Norman Brown and the late Ronny Jordan. I wanted to purchase a guitar that could produce any of those sounds.  Unfortunately you have to play that well also.  I purchase a Vox tube amp and am still in pursuit of the sound.  It is one of my better sounding guitars that I purchased for a bargain price.</p>
                <p>Artcore players represent a wide range of musical genres, but the Ibanez Artcore Expressionist AFJ191 Hollowbody Electric Guitar is dedicated to the jazz guitarist. That's probably obvious if you know your old school jazz boxes: wooden bridges, narrow frets. It features a spruce top and flamed maple back and sides for pure Jazz tone. The Super 58 Custom pickup delivers the smooth, nuanced tones with just enough growl for blues. The 20-fret fretboard produces that authentically warm jazz tone and to top it off: the AFJ191 comes equipped with high-quality flatwound strings.</p>
                  <div class="image">
                <img src="../pictures/pursuit.jpg" alt="Breedlove Pursuit Nylon">
            </div>
                 <h4>Breedlove Pursuit Nylon</h4>
                <p>I enjoy the playability and gorgeous sounds of nylon string guitars.  My favorite artists are Peter White, Marc Antone and of course Earl Klugh.  Another reason I enjoy nylon strings is because of my finger picking playing style. This is a high quality, well built, beautifully sounding instrument both plugged and unplugged, for a very reasonable price.  I enjoy using this instrument for personal worship time with God. </p>
                
                <p>Breedlove Pursuit Nylon - The top is western red cedar is a wonderful wood for strumming and fingerstyle players. It is softer than spruce, so it requires a careful and accurate touch, and it rewards with sweet, extended harmonic content. The back and sides are sapele, which is similar both visually and tonally to dense mahogany, but both darker and harder, giving it a strong visual presence and a bit more upper-harmonic content and low-end clarity. The Fishman ISYS-301 USB Preamp System includes a side-mounted preamp with rotary controls for volume, tone (bass/treble), and phase; a Fishman Sonicore pickup; onboard easy-to-read 7-segment LED tuner; and a combination battery box with 1/4"" output. </p> 
                <h4>Breedlove Discovery Concert CE</h4>
                 <div class="image">
                <img src="../pictures/discovery.jpg" alt="Breedlove Discovery Concert">
            </div>
                <p>There is nothing like a good sounding steel string acoustic but I did not have a big budget for a Martin or Taylor so I was looking for low cost good sounding steel string.  I found it in the Breedlove. While this is a well built great sounding guitar the plugged in sound has too much treble for my taste.  And without a preamp treble control I had to purchase a pedal equalizer to correct it.  Although I give the guitar high marks for playability and a great setup.</p>
                <p>The Breedlove Discovery Concert CE Acoustic Guitar with a slick cutaway design allowing easy access to upper frets. Finished with a high gloss on the top spruce and side mahogany portions, the Concert CE's features onboard Fishman electronics. The Breedlove Pinless Bridge helps maintain the integrity of the top by eliminating the need for six drilled string holes. Breedlove guitars feature a slimmer neck profile, hand-rubbed, semi-gloss finish also contributes to ideal playability.</p>
              
                <div class="image">
                <img src="../pictures/lespaul.jpg" alt="Ephiphone Les Paul Traditional PRO II">
            </div>
                <h4>Epiphone Les Paul Traditional PRO II</h4>
                <p>I once had a Les Paul and have been looking for one ever since I sold it over 20 years ago.I had a chance to buy a much better sounding and playing guitar.  I purchased this model because I could not buy another guitar after this one and wanted the versatility the PRO model allows to use single or double coils.  I enjoy playing this guitar but think I will have to make some upgrades to get a better sound for this guitar.</p>
                <p>Epiphone introduces the new Les Paul Traditional PRO-II featuring the ultimate combo of Alnico Classic PRO and ProBucker humbuckers with coil-splitting for an incredible range of tones. Plus a 15 dB boost switch along with new color finishes. The new Les Paul Traditional PRO-II has the classic build and profile of all Les Pauls with a solid mahogany body and a traditional carved top. The solid mahogany neck has a 1960's SlimTaper “D” profile with a 24.75 in. scale and is hand-fitted and glued into the body so the entire guitar resonates as a single piece of wood. A "worn" type finish on the back of the neck and body add to the lived-in feel. The neck has a rosewood fingerboard with 22 medium jumbo frets, single-ply cream binding, and mother-of-pearl trapezoid inlays.</p>

                <h3>Cars</h3>
                <p>Another interest I have is driving cars.  My current favorite make of car is a SAAB.  I have own five and am currently driving my second favorite. My first favorite was a 1989 SAAB 900 Turbo.</p>
                               <h4>SAAB 900 Turbo</h4>
                <div class="image">
                <img src="../pictures/saab900.jpg" alt="1989 SAAB 900 Turbo">
            </div>
                <p> This is my all time favorite car.  SAAB stands for Scandinavia Automobiles Airplans and Boats.  In my opinion this mode is an innovative, well built, high performing, cool designed and fun to drive car.  I drove my 900 into the ground and have been searching for another since.
                </p>
                
                <p>The 900 utilized a deeply curved front windshield, providing the best driver visibility, calling attention to the marque's aircraft legacy. Also underscoring their aircraft lineage, the 900's dashboard was curved to enable easy reach of all controls and featured gauges lit up from the front. Saab engineers placed all controls and gauges in the dashboard according to their frequency of use and/or importance so that the driver need only divert his gaze from the road for the shortest possible time and by the smallest angle. This is why, for example, the oft-used radio is placed so high in the dashboard. In keeping with the paradigm of its predecessor, the 99 model, the 900 employed a door design unique in automotive manufacturing, with an undercutting sweep to meet the undercarriage, forming a tight, solid unit when the door was closed.</p> 
                               <h4>SAAB 9-3 Viggen</h4>
                 <div class="image">
                     <img src="../pictures/saab93viggen.jpg" alt="2000 SAAB 9-3 Viggen"> </div>
                <p>I read about this car while I was searching for another 900.  I found this 9-3 Viggen which is name after the SAAB Viggen fighter jet.  Another very enjoyable and fun car to drive.  It  was a great deal for a car with low mileage and in excellent running condition.  The car still needs a little body work and a paint job to restore it to its original condition.</p>
                <p>These are rare. The Saab 9-3 Viggen were only made from 1999-2002 and were only available with a standard transmission, and limited colors (just blue in 1999, with silver and black added in 2000, other colors like red later). They started off with a standard 9-3, but put in a better engine from the 9-5, a larger turbo-charger, better computer, improved stiffer and lower suspension (springs, dampers, anti-roll bars and steering rack mounts), better 17" wheels, sportier and more aerodynamic trim (reducing aerodynamic drag by 8% to a 0.31 coefficient and reducing lift forces over the rear wheels by 60%), larger and grooved rotors, different spoiler, upgraded clutch assembly, larger diameter and stronger driveshafts and strengthened CV joints, improved seats, amongst other changes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Less than 3000 Viggens total were made in 2000, with only about 800 total imported into the USA. My silver 2000 4-door (well, they really call it "5-door") non-convertible is one of only 400 imported into the USA.  Performance wise they were design to beat the BMW M3 but failed. It can go from 0-60 in 6.5 seconds and do the quarter mile in 15 seconds flat.</p>
