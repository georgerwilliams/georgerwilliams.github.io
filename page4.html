                                            <h5>The Rally</h5>
                                            <p>Jesse Clyde (J.C.) Nichols was born in 1880 in the free state of Kansas.  He
                                            transformed Kansas City by building the stunning Country Club Plaza and developing attractive tree-lined residential subdivisions where homes continue to appreciate in value nearly a century later. But for decades, Nichols perpetuated an ugly cancer that has had a long lasting effect on housing, education and the economics of African Americans in greater Kansas City.  In 1948, wwo years before his death from a physical cancer, the Supreme Court in the Shelley Vs. Kraemer case struck down the racially restrictive housing covenants.</p>
                                            <p>I moved to this community because I wanted the same thing that any other resident wants for their children, safety and education.  But for nearly two decades I have been a resident of a city whose homes have these cancerous covenants and a feeling of unwelcome.  And while there are brief seasons the cancer is ignored as if it went into remission, unjust events like, the death of Mr. George Floyd become a relapse with a vengence.</p>
                                            <p>My pastor and his wife had the ideal to do a rally to speak out against the unjust.  My wife and I were glad to join in organizing the event.  My wife was instrumental in bring key leaders and students to the table and with the help of the team over 2,000 people attended.  The sight was more beautiful than any building errected by J.C. Nichols.  A city with an ugly history showed how beautiful it is when diverse people unite in sorrow, compassion and love to heal that cancer.</p>

												<h5>The Mission Statement</h5>
                                                <img src="images/pic043.jpg" alt="Mission">

We were involved in the rally at the vacant Macy’s parking lot last June that was covered by the KC Star. Our mission is to Stand up To Advocate for Neighborhood Diversity, equity and inclusion. Allying and raising awareness of the injustices of marginalized people and educating and inspiring, systemic change through collaboration with our community.</p>

												<h5>Take Action</h5>
                                                <img src="images/pic040.jpg" alt="guitars">

                                                <p>The Les Paul model is one of the standards for solid body guitars.  I had one years ago and was looking for another.  Although I had found a much better sounding and playing one I opted for this model because of the ability to split the coils for the pickups.</p>
                                                <p>Epiphone introduces the new Les Paul Traditional PRO-II featuring the ultimate combo of Alnico Classic PRO and ProBucker humbuckers with coil-splitting for an incredible range of tones. Plus a 15 dB boost switch along with new color finishes. The new Les Paul Traditional PRO-II has the classic build and profile of all Les Pauls with a solid mahogany body and a traditional carved top. The solid mahogany neck has a 1960's SlimTaper “D” profile with a 24.75 in. scale and is hand-fitted and glued into the body so the entire guitar resonates as a single piece of wood. A "worn" type finish on the back of the neck and body add to the lived-in feel. The neck has a rosewood fingerboard with 22 medium jumbo frets, single-ply cream binding, and mother-of-pearl trapezoid inlays.</p>
