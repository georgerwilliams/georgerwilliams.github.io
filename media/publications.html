                    <p>Why Fathers Count: The Importance of Fathers and Their Involvement with Children (edited by Sean E. Brotherson and Joseph M. White) is an anthology (27 articles) dealing with the most important work men ever do - being totally involved in the lives of their children and families.  I authored chapter 8 on playing with your child</p>
                    <p>It is men's strengths, their capacity to care and protect and give, that are needed by children, women, and men themselves. Why Fathers Count offers insight, giving a fresh and powerful perspective on the meaningful contributions of fathers and father figures to the lives of children and families.</p></td></tr></table>

I wrote this curriculum based on my experience working in a drug court diversion program and fathering court diversion program after completing my Master's in Marriage and Family Therapy.</p>
                            <p>This research and theory-based curriculum is a blueprint for guided programming interventions with fathers and is designed to be useful for fathers in any social service based setting (courts, prisons, employment agencies, hospitals, drug rehabilitation centers, etc.) in any fathering situation (teen, single, married, divorced, non-custodial, step, father-figures etc.). It is a tool to transform the dysfunctional father into a functioning father and the functioning father into a higher functioning father.</p></td></tr></table>

<p>The R.E.A.D. to Kids curriculum was designed with four specific attainable goals:
<br>-Dads practice reading to their children at least five (5) minutes a day, five (5) days a week.
<br>-Dads partner with their child’s teacher by visiting at least once a month.
<br>-Dads are present at their child’s school at least twice a month.
<br>-Dads will learn practical on-going fathering skills they can use daily to help children at school and home.

This is accomplished by promoting father engagement in the areas of playing, reading, talking and caring for their children.</p>
                            <p>I wrote the Strong Dads curriculum that focused increasing father engagement for the well-being of their children. Research shows that a father’s love is just as important as a mother’s love in terms of a child’s happiness, well-being, social and academic success, emotional stability and self-esteem.</p></td></tr></table>

The National Mentoring Partnership (Mentor, 2006) conducted poll on mentoring, surveying formal and informal adult mentors and non-mentors.

M2M Fraternity supplements the Kauffman Scholar’s comprehensive programming by bringing in male facilitators to intentionally help re-educate and re-socialize these males in the knowledge, values and skills around becoming a mature man to position them for winning success in their education and personal life (Mincy, 2006).  Additionally, M2M Fraternity works with academic coaches, life coaches and parents, particularly fathers and father-figures to learn ways they can bring additional support to the students (McClanahan, 2003).</p>
<p>M2M Fraternity begins with a twelve (12)-unit curriculum that can be completed in four (4) sessions.  The curriculum is based on four universal values of respect, responsibility, relationships and rightness (Williams, 2006) and integrates the topics of education, manhood, and life skills (Josephson, 2002).  At the completion of the twelve (12) units the males are brought into the M2M Fraternity that meet once a month for on-going support and service including recruiting and future mentoring elementary age male students in similar curriculum topics to set them on course to win through college (Tindale, et. al., 1998).</p>
