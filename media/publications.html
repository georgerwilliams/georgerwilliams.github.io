                <h1> Sample Writings </h1>
                <p>Below are three samples of the many articles and curricula I have authored.  Click on the icon to download the publication.  The book chapter of Why Fathers Count, the sample first lesson of Quenching the Father Thirst and the entire Strong Dads curriculum.</p>

                    <p><b>Why Fathers Count</b></p></center>
                    <p>Authored the eighth chapter in this book on playing with your child. Why Fathers Count: The Importance of Fathers and Their Involvement with Children (edited by Sean E. Brotherson and Joseph M. White) is an anthology (27 articles) dealing with the most important work men ever do - being totally involved in the lives of their children and families.  Why Fathers Count offers insight, giving a fresh and powerful perspective on the meaningful contributions of fathers and father figures to the lives of children and families.</p>

                    <p><b>Quenching the Father-Thirst</b></p></center>
                    <p>Authored the breakthrough curriculum Quenching the Father Thirst: Developing a Dad for the National Center for Fathering to train men to become responsible fathers/father figures that love, know and guide their children to success.  This research and theory-based curriculum is a blueprint for guided programming interventions with fathers and is designed to be useful for fathers in any social service based setting (courts, prisons, employment agencies, hospitals, drug rehabilitation centers, etc.) in any fathering situation (teen, single, married, divorced, non-custodial, step, father-figures etc.). It is a tool to transform the dysfunctional father into a functioning father and the functioning father into a higher functioning father.</p>

                <div class="box">
                    
                    <center><a href="../supplements/strongdads.pdf"><img src="../pictures/strongdads.jpg"></a><p><b>Strong Dads, Super Kids curriculum</b></p></center>
                        <p>Through the Kansas Department for Children and Families' (DCF) partnership with Kansas head start and Kansas early head start, Strong Dads encouraged fathers to improve their children’s school-readiness across what Head Start identifies as four essential domains that include language and literacy, cognitive, physical, and social-emotional development. This is accomplished by promoting father engagement in the areas of playing, reading, talking and caring for their children.</p>
                            <p>I wrote the Strong Dads curriculum that focused increasing father engagement for the well-being of their children. Research shows that a father’s love is just as important as a mother’s love in terms of a child’s happiness, well-being, social and academic success, emotional stability and self-esteem.</p>
