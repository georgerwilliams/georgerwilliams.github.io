                    <p><b>Why Fathers Count</b></p></center>
                    <p>Authored the eighth chapter in this book on playing with your child. Why Fathers Count: The Importance of Fathers and Their Involvement with Children (edited by Sean E. Brotherson and Joseph M. White) is an anthology (27 articles) dealing with the most important work men ever do - being totally involved in the lives of their children and families.  Why Fathers Count offers insight, giving a fresh and powerful perspective on the meaningful contributions of fathers and father figures to the lives of children and families.</p>

                    <p><b>Quenching the Father-Thirst</b></p></center>
                    <p>Authored the breakthrough curriculum Quenching the Father Thirst: Developing a Dad for the National Center for Fathering to train men to become responsible fathers/father figures that love, know and guide their children to success.  This research and theory-based curriculum is a blueprint for guided programming interventions with fathers and is designed to be useful for fathers in any social service based setting (courts, prisons, employment agencies, hospitals, drug rehabilitation centers, etc.) in any fathering situation (teen, single, married, divorced, non-custodial, step, father-figures etc.). It is a tool to transform the dysfunctional father into a functioning father and the functioning father into a higher functioning father.</p>

                        <p>Through the Kansas Department for Children and Families' (DCF) partnership with Kansas head start and Kansas early head start, Strong Dads encouraged fathers to improve their children’s school-readiness across what Head Start identifies as four essential domains that include language and literacy, cognitive, physical, and social-emotional development. This is accomplished by promoting father engagement in the areas of playing, reading, talking and caring for their children.</p>
                            <p>I wrote the Strong Dads curriculum that focused increasing father engagement for the well-being of their children. Research shows that a father’s love is just as important as a mother’s love in terms of a child’s happiness, well-being, social and academic success, emotional stability and self-esteem.</p>

                     <p><b>Hope Mentoring curriculum</b></p></center>
                        <td><p>The Kansas Department for Children and Families’ (DCF) purpose is to protect children, promote healthy families and encourage personal responsibility. The HOPE Mentoring program assists recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to make a voluntary connection with a Mentor who will come alongside the Mentee and encourage him/her in pursuing opportunities to grow in self-reliance.

                            <p>
The National Mentoring Partnership (Mentor, 2006) conducted poll on mentoring, surveying formal and informal adult mentors and non-mentors. Mentors were surveyed about the challenges they faced during mentoring and responded that their experiences could have been improved and challenges overcome in a number of ways including:  Having more materials/resources available  Being better informed/more knowledgeable  Receiving better training</p>

                <p>Here is a collection of feedback quotes by conference attendees.  This is followed by a list of some of my state and national conference presentations:</p>
<hr>
<p>“Amazing trainer; George knows what he is talking about!  I am a big fan!  Awesome at keeping my attention; it was inspirational, informative, and entertaining with the poems, songs and videos.  Made me evaluate my relationship with my father and why dads are so important in a child’s development. I absolutely recommend this session to others.”
<br>- Super Dads and Kids presentation for KCSL Parent Leadership Conference</p>
<hr>
<p> “George is extremely charismatic, engaging and shows lots of passion for fatherhood.  Incredible and creative, this was the best presentation yet with excellent materials!  I highly recommend this workshop again.  He touched my heart – made me want to work very hard to make it easier for father involvement in my program.” 
    <br>– Secret Life of Men at TFI Fatherhood Symposium</p>
<hr>
<p>“George was great; wow; fabulous; I wanted more.  I was very impressed with his knowledge, audience engagement and down-to-earth message.   It kept my attention and I felt what was being said through Life sentence without a father, Man jacked, the PowerPoint and handout.  The demonstrations and visuals really helped in understanding the impact of my actions in the relationships I have with others. This didn’t just apply to me and my family but my work, friends, and family members;”
    <br>– It’s Better Together at KCSL Parent Leadership Conference</p>
<hr>
 <p>“George is very talented and his artistic ability to share amazing and most helpful information was thought-provoking and enlightening to me.  This was the best training I attended.  I am impressed by the passion, sharing, and emotions that took place in this session.  Excellent visual illustrations engaged many modalities including music, word pictures, oral interpretation poetry, group participation (non-threatening) paring up with a partner.  ”
