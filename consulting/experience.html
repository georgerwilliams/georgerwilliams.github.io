                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <div class="underline"></div> 
                <p>My self-assessment as an employee that has spanned three decades is characterized as hard working, conscientious, adaptive, creative and service oriented.</p>
                <p>My computer science work experience began in 1984 as a programmer analyst for Conoco Oil Company and continued at Hunt-Wesson, Douglas Aircraft Company, which later become McDonnell Douglas Aircraft and finally Boeing. At the end of my computer science career I was a senior programmer specialist. The experience gained from my time in this industry is hard to capture in a few paragraphs. These position required constant training, the ability to understand business process, researching legacy systems, satisfying business users requirements, technical expertise and teamwork.</p>
                <p>In 1998 I began working for the National Center for Fathering as a Director of Education. The next year I was promoted to Executive Director of the Urban Father-Child partnership. This was a position required leadership, office administration, initiative and creativity to do some major work in the Kansas City community and across the nation.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In 2007 I began the doctoral program at Kansas State University and resigned from full time employment. For the next four years I worked as a consultant. I continued part-time at the National Center for Fathering and wrote a proposal in 2008 to the Kauffman Scholars Program, Inc. to help create and implement a Boys to Men program to assist the recruitment and retention of more males into their college bound program. In 2009 I partnered with the Kansas City Community Center to write a proposal to Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City to write a grant to address family violence prevetion for men in two re-entry progams and a diversion program. In 2010 I partnered with the National Cener for Fathering to write a proposal for a grant that was awarded by the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City to address homeless fathers in three drug rehabilitation programs and homeless shelters. Also in 2010I was awarded a contract with the Mid-America Regional Council that was the grantee for Head Starts that served 3,000 families in the KC area where I work to integrate fatherhood efforts among the sites.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In 2011 I was hired by the state of Kansas at a time of transition for a new Governor and throughout my career in state government I had the opportunity to utilize my expertise primarily in a director and special assistant position. As the Director of Addiction and Prevention Services(AAPS) I reported to the Deputy Secretary of Disability and Behavioral Health Services.</p>
                <p>As the Director of AAPS I was hired by the Deputy Secretary of Disability and Behavioral Services (DBHS), our division was responsible to partner with stakeholders to promote prevention and recovery in Kansas Communities.  As the delegated Single State Authority for addiction and prevention services I managed the $46 million in state and federal funds  With a staff of 23, which included five managers my duties include supervision of the managers, working with the over 270 licensed treatment providers (AAPS, Department of Corrections and Medicaid), monitoring up to 85 grants annually to meet federal and state statutory requirements, developing and promoting effective public policy, analyzing national and Kansas data and disseminating accurate information and continuous improvement through the development and evaluation of programmatic and human resources to reduce substance use disorder.</p>
                <p>In my position as a Special Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Strategic Development and Faith-Based and Community Initiatives I developed the Kansas Early Head Start Strong Dads program which promotes early and on-going engagement by fathers and father figures, through playing, reading, talking and caring for children ages birth through three. This 1.5 million dollar program worked with 14 grantees in 22 sites across the state to provide capacity building funding, a multi-media campaign, a new curriculum, the Strong Dads resource kit, programming and research to 1,000 families.  Currently working on an expansion of this program to include federal Head Start and Early Head Start programs in Kansas.</p>
                <p>I am overseeing statewide implementation of the Kansas Work for Success fatherhood program.  This half million dollar program helps fathers who are on government assistance and owe state arrears in child support to move to self sufficiency, paying child support and strengthening their relationships with their children and families. The program is awarded to a community organization that receives technical assistance to provide to fathers with mentoring, case management, fathering and relationship education, financial literacy and family violence prevention. This program uses the Quenching the Father Thirst curriculum that I wrote.</p>
                <p>I was appointed by the Secretary of DCF as the department liaison for the Governorâ€™s Mental Health Taskforce to assist in creating a report of recommendations for more effective services.  After the completion of the report the Secretary asked me to help oversee the planning of DCF projects and spending of seven million dollars in TANF funding. Through my work at the state II have gained experience in every aspect of the processes associated with grants and contracts including writing, reviewing, awarding and monitoring.  My work focus has been primarily fatherhood and family strengthening but also includes community leadership and capacity building.</p>

                <h1>Education</h1>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>My self-assessment as a student is characterized as a life long lover of learning for the purpose of application. In other words, not knowledge just for the sake of knowing but for the sake of doing.</p>
                <p>My 1981 post high school educational journey began in Kansas at Cloud County Community College where I attended on a track scholarship. The next year I transferred to Kansas State University and majored in Computer Science (CS). My brother was an electrical engineer and he stirred my interest in exploring the promising field of computer programming.</p>
                <p>During my senior year at KSU my interest was aroused in the social helping professions and the idea that I might later return to school for that training. I graduated with a B.S. in CS 1984. After spending thirteen years in the computer science industry in Oklahoma and California, I felt a calling to serve others. In 1997 I began attending California State University Dominguez Hills to fulfill the requirements of entering a master of science in clinical psychology.</p>
                <p>In 1998 I took a position at a fathering non-profit and the next year I began the pursuit of a masters in marriage and family therapy(MFT) to provide theory to guide me in the practice of helping fathers, mothers and children in family relationships. I graduated with my M.S. in MFT in 2001. In 2007 I began pursuing a doctorate in family studies(FS) as a way to complete the loop of theory, research and practice. I needed to be able to research the theories and promising practices to help the fathers, mothers and children in family relationships. I will graduate with my Ph.D. in FS in 2015.</p>
