<h1>Education</h1>
                <div class="underline"></div>
    <p>I am a lifelong learning, not for the sake of knowledge but for the sake of application.  My post high school educational journey began at a Community College where I attended on a track scholarship. The next year I transferred to Kansas State University and majored in Computer Science (CS).  I graduated with a bachelor of science in 1984.</p>
<p>In 1999 I began the pursuit of a masters in marriage and family therapy (MFT) at Friends University to provide theory to guide me in the practice of helping fathers, mothers and children in family relationships. I graduated with my masters in 2001.</p>
<p>In 2007 I began pursuing a doctorate in family studies(FS) to complete the loop of theory, research and practice. I needed to be able to research the theories and promising practices to help the fathers, mothers and children in family relationships. I graduated with my doctorate in 2016.
