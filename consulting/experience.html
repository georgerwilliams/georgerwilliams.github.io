                <div class="underline"></div> 
                <p>My passion is providing useful, engaging, innovative, continuously improving training, services and consulting that reflects the value I have for the people I serve.  Here are a few endorsements leaders acquainted with my work:</p>
                <hr>
                <p>"I've known George Williams for 20 years and his leadership in providing resources to strengthen fathers and address family related issues is superb.  George is an insightful professional who delivers both informative and inspirational messages.  His experience in developing practice based solutions is outstanding.  I highly recommend Dr. Williams in any capacity as a consultant, speaker and researcher.  He has my highest regard."</p>
<p>Ken R. Canfield, Ph.D.
<br>Founder, National Center for Fathering
<br>National Association for Grandparenting.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>"Dr. George Williams has been presenting the principles of healthy family life to the men at USP Leavenworth for over ten years.  I've witnessed the power of his hands on teaching style which gets all the participants thinking and involved.  He brings the most recent methods and statistics to bear in his teaching and he uses a variety of teaching methods ranging from singing, to games, to workbooks and discussions.  I offer my unequivocal endorsement of Dr. Williams as a seminar leader on family life issues."</p>
 
<p>Chaplain Kendall Hughes, D.Div.
    <br>Supervisory Chaplain,  USP Leavenworth</p>
                <hr>
                <p>"Wow, George really has the gift of presenting information in a moving, thought provoking and meaningful way.  I am certain he does not lose anyone's attention in the room while making his presentations.  I have never been to a breakout session like his.  I know others were impressed.  The biggest impact I felt from his  session was when he was acting out the feelings of fathers and children.  What an effective way to get a message across.  I believe the message of the importance of fathers in a child's life needs to get out."</p>

<h1>Employment</h1>
                <p><b>Nation-wide: National Center for Fathering</b><br>Working as executive director at the National Center for Fathering was a revolutionary experience for me.  The annual operating budget for the center was over $2 million.  For 10 years I worked with other talented and passionate staff to inspire and equip fathers at the local, state and national level to be the fathers their children needed.  I successfully experienced every aspect of helping to run a not-for-profit organization.</p> 
                <p>Over the years I have been enriched by the opportunities to have spoken at state and national conferences, written for and appeared in national magazines, trained trainers across the country, appeared on national news, been a reoccurring guest on a talk show, held workshops for a professional football team, testified as an expert witness before a Senate subcommittee, authored curricula, became a contributing author for an anthology on fatherhood, and visited the first Lady’s White House conference and reception.  But my highest honor and inspiration was working with thousands of men who are striving to be the fathers their children need.<p>

<h1>Education</h1>
                <div class="underline"></div>
    <p>I am a lifelong learning, not for the sake of knowledge but for the sake of application.  My post high school educational journey began at a Community College where I attended on a track scholarship. The next year I transferred to Kansas State University and majored in Computer Science (CS).  I graduated with a bachelor of science in 1984.</p>
<p>In 1999 I began the pursuit of a masters in marriage and family therapy (MFT) at Friends University to provide theory to guide me in the practice of helping fathers, mothers and children in family relationships. I graduated with my masters in 2001.</p>
<p>In 2007 I began pursuing a doctorate in family studies(FS) to complete the loop of theory, research and practice. I needed to be able to research the theories and promising practices to help the fathers, mothers and children in family relationships. I graduated with my doctorate in 2016.
