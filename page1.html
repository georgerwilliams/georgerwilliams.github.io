                    <h3>National Center for Fathering</h3>
                        <p>Working as executive director at the National Center for Fathering was a revolutionary experience for me. The annual operating budget for the center was over $2 million. For 10 years I worked with other talented and passionate staff to inspire and equip fathers at the local, state and national level to be the fathers their children needed. I successfully experienced every aspect of helping to run a not-for-profit organization.</p>
                        <p>Over the years I have been enriched by the opportunities to have spoken at state and national conferences, written for and appeared in national magazines, trained trainers across the country, appeared on national news, been a reoccurring guest on a talk show, held workshops for a professional football team, testified as an expert witness before a Senate subcommittee, authored curricula, became a contributing author for an anthology on fatherhood, and visited the first Lady’s White House conference and reception. But my highest honor and inspiration was working with thousands of men who are striving to be the fathers their children need.</p>

                        <h3>Department for Children and Families</h3>
                        <p>For the past 8 years I've been priviledge to provide support to Kansas citizens in my roles as assistant director and special assistant in the Department for Children and Families (DCF). Served on the DCF Secretary’s executive team, meeting twice a week for two years for agency reporting, planning and team decisions. Wrote requests for proposal, reviewed, and awarded grants and contracts for millions of dollars of social programming. Led, planned, developed, and implemented the innovative Kansas Strong Dads program with a $1.5 million budget with 19 partnering organizations, in which hundreds of Early Head Start families were assisted. Created and delivered trainings for hundreds of Kansas citizens and agency staff for fatherhood, leadership and mentoring. Currently working on social worker retention by developing and delivering CEU courses for DCF's 1,500 social workers. </p>
                        <p>As a former director of Addiction and Prevention Services I was the designated single state authority for the field. Directed a staff of 23 including five managers with an operating budget of $46 million. Experiences include hiring staff, performance reviews, progress reporting, team building, regular management team meetings, site visits, program policies, automated systems and budget meetings. Worked with over 200 providers of substance abuse disorder (SUD) and various associations, stakeholders and community partners on substance use disorder policy, prevention, rehabilitation and recovery of clients.</p>
