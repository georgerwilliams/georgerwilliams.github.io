<strong> How can I serve you?</strong> My life mission is reflected in the words of Nobel Peace Prize winner Albert Schweitzer, “The purpose of human life is to serve, and to show compassion and the will to help others.” For almost two decades my life work has been driven by the passion to bring innovative, relevant, engaging, and competency enriching services and resources to helping professionals and organizations who serve families and communities. These services include keynotes, workshops, training, programming, curriculum development, writing, research and consulting.
                        </p>
<p><strong> Let's work together! </strong> My education as a marriage and family therapist and family studies researcher and my experiences working corporate, not-for-profit, faith community, consultant and state government leadership positions and my skills as a manager, trainer, presenter, curriculum developer, program implementer and grant writer give me a unique edge to achieving your vision to strengthen youth, fathers, families in your community.  It is my relentless pursuit to create superior experiences that lead to an uplifting community impact.
