                        <h2>My Endorsements</h2>
                        <h3>Tech Endorsement</h3>
                        "Dr. George Williams has a passion for people of color to have the same opportunities of access to technology education he’s experienced.  He is highly skilled in making learning memorable and enjoyable.  I witnessed this firsthand with the multi-session Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Camp he helped organize and lead with the Tunica-Biloxi tribe of Louisiana.
						<br>
                        <br>Dr. George has over a decade of experience working in Information Technology as a senior programmer analyst for Fortune 500 companies including the Boeing Company, ConocoPhillips Oil Company and Conagra Brands, Inc.  All the above coupled with his formal education of a Bachelor of Science in computer science and his ability to continue to learn and apply new technologies makes Dr. George Williams someone I can endorse without reservation for creating and delivering STEM curricula and training."

                        <br>Executive Director and Founder Discover Lab-Global
                        <br>Former DARPA Manager
                        <br>Retired Major in the U.S. Airforce
						<p></p>
                       <h3>DEI Endorsement</h3>                        
                        "I have known Dr. George Williams during the past five years, initially when he was an Assistant Director with the Kansas Dept. for Children and Families, and most recently as a curriculum developer, researcher and training consultant. He is someone who cares for people and justice.
						<br>
                        <br>I remember the first time I saw how gifted Dr. George was in creating and delivering trainings when I sat in his fatherhood train-the-trainer class.  I again experienced it when he helped put together and facilitated a mentoring curriculum.  I was so impressed I hired him to put together two Diversity, Equity and Inclusion curricula for my company.  The first was “Cultural Proficiency Enrichment” and the second “Implicit Bias Awareness” and both of these have garnered business and praise from our non-profit, government, police and business clients.
						<br>
                        <br>I have also seen his passion in getting involved in activism for justice with the silent march and rally he helped organize, the Black History program he produced for his city, his work with the Mayor’s Diversity Committee and the police department’s Civil Service Board and work with the Johnson County NAACP.  He is not just talking about justice but is acting justly, with compassion and walking humbly as an activist for all his fellow citizens.
						<br>
                        <br>Dr. Williams is a joy to work with, and I recommend him highly as a great asset to any organization where Diversity, Equity and Inclusion leadership and staff development are of great importance."

                        <h3>Trauma-Resiliency Endorsement</h3>
                        Dr. George Williams has put to good use his education and experience as a trained marriage and family therapist and family life education consultant.  He has infused trauma-resiliency learning and practice based on the ACE’s study into all his individual and family social helping.  
						<br>
                        <br>Dr. George’s “superpower” of empathy has driven him through his own experiences and compassion for the experiences of others with an urgency to create innovative and engaging competency-based trauma-resiliency curricula, trainings and presentations.  He has done this for nearly 500 social workers in Kansas with his highly rated “Trauma, Drama, and Calm,” “Self-Caring Preventative Attention,” and Trauma-Informed Fathering curricula and trainings and also, with “Somatic Experience Trauma Informed Parenting.” 
						<br>
                        <br>Dr. George’s masterful presentation skills uses artistry, sincerely and humility to connect with the audience as a guide on the journey of experiential and practical learning.  I recommend Dr. George Williams without hesitation for any curriculum development, presenting or leadership role in the field of trauma-resiliency.

                        I've known Dr. George Williams for 20 years and his leadership in providing resources to strengthen fathers and address family related issues is superb. George is an insightful professional who delivers both informative and inspirational messages. His experience in developing practice based solutions is outstanding. I highly recommend Dr. Williams in any capacity as a consultant, speaker and researcher. He has my highest regard."
